# Structured Eligibility Criteria Proof of Concept (aka SEC POC) Admin App

This is an R/Shiny administration app used in the CTRP SEC POC project.

For development, see the "R Development" section of the [README](https://github.com/CBIIT/sec_poc/blob/master/README.md) for the sec_poc repo.

You will also need to set up your admim credentials in the SQLlite DB by running [init_user_db.R](https://github.com/CBIIT/sec_admin/blob/master/init_user_db.R).
